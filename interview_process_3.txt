// Question:
// Execute a function when any of the links inside a list are clicked

// 1. Repeat the question back / ask questions
// What framework are we using? - JQuery or vanilla ES2019
// Is it the same function for all links?
// Should the default action be prevented?
// How many links can the list contain?
// Should it work for links that are dynamically added?

// 2. Discuss the solution
// - Use onclick callback for each link? But what if new links get added
// - Create a template for each link? But we can have millions of links, too much duplication
// - Use event delegation for the root DOM? Nice!

// 3. Code it up
/*
list.addEventListener('click', e => {
    if (e.target.nodeName === 'A') {
        callback(e);
    }
});
*/

// 4. Test it out
// Would have to run it

// 5. Iterate on your solution

// 6. Be yourself!
