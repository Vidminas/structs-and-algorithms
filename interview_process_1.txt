// Question:
// Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams

// 1. repeat the question back
// Find out whether two strings contain the same characters

// 2. ask about edge cases
// How much memory can I use?
// What language are the strings?
// Are there any special characters, or are they all letters?
// Does the case matter?
// What about whitespace?

// 3. think of a solution
// sort the strings and check if the results are the same

// 4. talk through your code
// ...

// 5. manual walkthrough testing, e.g. with "draw" and "ward"
// how about unequal length strings, e.g. "face" and "faces"?

// 6. iterate through the process:
//  - what is the time complexity of your solution? O(n*lgn)
//  - what is the space complexity of your solution? O(n)
//  can you do better?
