// Question:
// Given a tree, determine if it is a binary search tree

// 1. Repeat the question back
// For a given binary tree, check if for every node:
// - its child on the left is smaller than its parent
// and its child on the right is greater than its parent

// 2. Ask questions
// What is a binary search tree?
// How is the tree represented? - Suppose every node has a value and 2 pointers
// Is the given tree acyclic?
// Are the values unique?

// 3. Discuss
// Advantages of using an iterative vs recursive approach?

// 4. Code it up and talk through
// ...

// 5. Test the solution
